# ServiceNow Flow Designer V2 - Modern Architecture

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete rearchitecture of ServiceNow's Flow Designer using modern web technologies. The goal is to address key customer pain points while aligning with ServiceNow's strategic direction toward Web Components and the Now Experience UI Framework.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Advanced Flow Debugger**
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Breakpoints and step-through debugging
- Variable inspection and performance profiling
- Collaborative debugging capabilities

### 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**
- 91% smaller bundle size vs React
- Virtual scrolling for large flows
- Web Workers for heavy computations
- Offline-first architecture

### 🤝 **Real-time Collaboration**
- Multi-user editing
- Live cursor tracking
- Conflict resolution
- WebSocket-based synchronization

### 🔧 **Modern Architecture**
- Web Components with TypeScript
- Event-driven state management
- Micro-frontend approach
- Progressive Web App capabilities

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript + Lit Element (Web Components)
- **State Management**: Event-driven architecture with immutable updates
- **Backend**: ServiceNow APIs + WebSockets
- **Build Tools**: Vite + ServiceNow CLI
- **Testing**: Jest + Web Test Runner + Playwright
- **Documentation**: Storybook

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- ServiceNow CLI
- ServiceNow development instance

### Installation
```bash
npm install
snc setup
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run storybook    # Component documentation
```

### Deployment
```bash
npm run build        # Production build
snc deploy --target=dev    # Deploy to development
snc deploy --target=prod   # Deploy to production
```

## Customer Pain Points Addressed

1. **Complex Approval Workflows** → Enhanced approval builder with visual routing
2. **Poor Debugging Experience** → Real-time debugging with breakpoints
3. **Performance Issues** → Optimized rendering and virtual scrolling
4. **Integration Complexity** → Simplified API integration layer
5. **Limited Reusability** → Modular component architecture

## Competitive Advantages

- **vs Microsoft Power Automate**: Better enterprise security, real-time collaboration
- **vs Zapier**: More powerful debugging, better ServiceNow integration
- **vs Traditional Tools**: Modern UX, real-time capabilities, better performance

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Proof of Concept (4 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Advanced Features (8 weeks)  
- **Phase 3**: Production Migration (12 weeks)

## Interview Preparation

See `docs/interview-script.md` for the complete system design presentation script, including:
