---

## 🚀 **Opening Statement** (30 seconds)

> "I've built a complete rearchitecture of ServiceNow's Flow Designer using modern web technologies to address our customers' biggest pain point: **Complex Approval Workflows**. This demonstrates how we can solve real business problems with modern architecture."

---

## 🎬 **Demo Flow** (6-7 minutes)

### **1. Show the Problem** (1 minute)
**Say:** *"Let me show you what customers struggle with today..."*

**Actions:**
1. Click **📋 Create Sample Workflow**
2. Point to the 5-step approval process
3. **Highlight the complexity:**
   - "Employee submits request"
   - "Manager approval required" 
   - "Amount check - if over $5,000"
   - "Finance director approval"
   - "Purchase order generation"

**Key Message:** *"This is a simple purchase approval, but customers struggle with multi-approver scenarios, conditional logic, and parallel approval chains."*

### **2. Demonstrate Modern Architecture** (2 minutes)
**Say:** *"Now let me show you how modern architecture solves this..."*

**Actions:**
1. **Click on "Direct Manager Approval" node**
2. **Show Properties Panel:**
   - Point to "Approver Selection" 
   - Click on "Sarah Johnson" to select her
   - Show the ✓ checkmark and blue highlight
   - Change timeout from 24 to 48 hours
   - Show real-time updates

3. **Click on "Amount > $5,000?" condition node**
   - Show field: "amount"
   - Show operator: ">" 
   - Show value: "5000"
   - Explain: "This creates conditional logic automatically"

**Key Message:** *"Web Components with Lit Element provide real-time updates, type safety, and modern developer experience while aligning with ServiceNow's Now Experience UI Framework."*

### **3. Show Visual Flow Management** (1.5 minutes)
**Say:** *"The visual flow makes complex logic intuitive..."*

**Actions:**
1. **Point to step numbers 1-5** on each node
2. **Click ➡️ on "Manager Approval"** to move it right
3. **Show the reordering:** Step numbers update automatically
4. **Point to blue connection lines** with arrows
5. **Click 🔄 Auto Arrange** to show automatic layout

**Key Message:** *"Visual step numbers, drag-and-drop reordering, and automatic connections make complex workflows manageable for business users."*

### **4. Demonstrate Enterprise Features** (1.5 minutes)
**Say:** *"Built for enterprise scale and security..."*

**Actions:**
1. **Click 🐛 Debug Everything** 
   - Show console logs with complete workflow state
   - Point to structured data and validation

2. **Click Validate** button
   - Show "Valid workflow" status
   - Explain validation rules

3. **Click Save Workflow**
   - Show "Workflow saved!" message
   - Explain optimistic updates

4. **Click 🚀 Deploy**
   - Show deployment confirmation dialog
   - Explain: "This makes the workflow LIVE in ServiceNow"
   - Show "Workflow is now LIVE in ServiceNow!" message

5. **Click 🧪 Test**
   - Show test execution and results
   - Explain: "Validates the workflow logic works correctly"

6. **Click 📋 View Sample Request**
   - Show what a real request would look like
   - Display actual form field values (not just template)
   - Explain: "This is what users see when they submit requests"

**Key Message:** *"Event-driven architecture, comprehensive validation, and offline-first design ensure enterprise reliability. The complete flow from design to deployment to runtime execution."*

### **5. Explain the Complete Workflow Lifecycle** (1 minute)
**Say:** *"Let me explain what happens after deployment..."*

**Key Points:**
1. **Flow Designer = Design Tool** (like an architect's blueprint)
2. **ServiceNow = Runtime Platform** (where the actual work happens)
3. **After Deploy:** Workflow becomes LIVE in ServiceNow
4. **Where it appears:**
   - ServiceNow Admin Console (for management)
   - ServiceNow Catalog (for users to submit requests)
   - ServiceNow Task Management (for approvers)
   - ServiceNow Reports (for analytics)

**The Complete Flow:**
```
Design in Flow Designer → Deploy to ServiceNow → Users submit requests → 
Workflow executes → Approvers get tasks → Final decision delivered
```

**Key Message:** *"Flow Designer is the design tool. ServiceNow is where the actual workflow execution happens. This separation of concerns allows for better maintainability and scalability."*
